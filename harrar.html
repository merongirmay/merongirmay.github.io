                <h2>Harrar Jugol</h2>
                <p>The fortified historic town of Harar is located in the eastern part of Ethiopia, 525 km from the
                    capital of Addis Ababa, on a plateau with deep gorges surrounded by deserts and savannah. The walls
                    surrounding this sacred city, considered “the fourth holy city” of Islam, were built between the
                    13th and 16th centuries and served as a protective barrier. There were five historic gates, which
                    corresponded to the main roads to the town and also served to divide the city into five
                    neighbourhoods, but this division is not functional anymore. The Harar gate, from where the main
                    streets lead to the centre, is of recent construction.

                <h2>Mosque</h2>
                <p>Harar Jugol numbers 82 mosques, three of which date from the 10th century, 102 shrines and a number
                    of traditional, Indian and combined townhouses with unique interior designs, which constitute a
                    spectacular part of Harar's cultural heritage. The African and Islamic traditions influenced over a
                    long period of time the development of the city and its typical urban planning and contributed to
                    its particular character and uniqueness. The present urban layout follows the 16th century design
                    for an Islamic town with its central core occupied with commercial and religious buildings and a
                    maze of narrow alleyways with imposing facades. The traditional Harari house has a typical, specific
                    and original architectural form, different from the domestic layout usually known in Muslim
                    countries, although reminiscent of the coastal Arab architecture, and with an exceptional interior
                    design. At the end of the 19thcentury Indian merchants built new houses with wooden verandas that
                    defined a different urban landscape and influenced the construction of the combined Indian/Harari
                    houses. Their architectural and ornamental qualities are now part of the Harari cultural heritage.

                <p>Harar functioned as the capital of the Harari Kingdom from 1520 to 1568, became an independent
                    emirate in the 17th century and was integrated into Ethiopia in 1887. From the late 16th century to
                    the 19th century Harar was an important trade centre between the coast and the interior highlands
                    and a location for Islamic learning.</p>

                <p>Today Harar is the administrative capital of the Harari People National Regional State (HPNRS). The
                    historic town has a traditionally functioning community, forming a complex social-environmental
                    whole where each element has its symbolic and practical significance. The Harari people are
                    distinguished by the continued cultural traditions and quality of their handicrafts, including
                    weaving, basket making and book binding. The organization of the communities through traditional
                    systems has preserved its social and physical inheritance and, significantly, the Harari language.

                <h2>Harar coffee</h2>
                <p>
                    Ethiopian Harrar coffee is generally highly rated and known for its winey and fruity, floral-toned
                    acidity - bright in the cup, even intense - and tasting notes describe it with a rich and pungent,
                    heady aroma that is wonderfully reminiscent of blackberries.

                    A good Harrar is bold and edgy with a complexity and spice tones that may include cinnamon,
                    cardamom, blueberry jam, apricots, compote, even smoke, and with a lingering finish.</p>
