        <h2>Axum</h2>
        <p>Situated in the highlands of northern Ethiopia, Aksum symbolizes the wealth and importance of the
          civilization of the ancient Aksumite kingdom, which lasted from the 1st to the 8th centuries AD. The kingdom
          was at the crossroads of the three continents: Africa, Arabia and the Greco-Roman World, and was the most
          powerful state between the Eastern Roman Empire and Persia. In command of the ivory trade with Sudan, its
          fleets controlled the Red Sea trade through the port of Adulis and the inland routes of north eastern Africa.

        <h2>Axum</h2>
        <p>The ruins of the ancient Aksumite Civilization covered a wide area in the Tigray Plateau. The most impressive
          monuments are the monolithic obelisks, royal tombs and the palace ruins dating to the 6th and 7th centuries
          AD.
          Several stelae survive in the town of Aksum dating between the 3rd and 4th centuries AD. The largest standing
          obelisk rises to a height of over 23 meters and is exquisitely carved to represent a nine-storey building of
          the Aksumites. It stands at the entrance of the main stelae area. The largest obelisk of some 33 meters long
          lies where it fell, perhaps during the process of erection. It is possibly the largest monolithic stele that
          ancient human beings ever attempted to erect.

        <h2>Axum</h2>
        <p>A series of inscription on stone tablets have proved to be of immense importance to historians of the ancient
          world. Some of them include trilingual text in Greek, Sabaean and Ge'ez (Classical Ethiopian), inscribed by
          King Ezana in the 4th century AD.
          The introduction of Christianity in the 4th century AD resulted in the building of churches, such as Saint
          Mary of Zion, rebuilt in the Gondarian period, in the 17th century AD, which is believed to hold the Ark of
          the Covenant.
